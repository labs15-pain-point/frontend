                You’ll notice that some of the random ideas we serve up after all this filtering are still nonsense while other company descriptions sound rather legitimate. We still have some crud, which is where this site comes in. By upvoting and downvoting company descriptions you help us label and filter descriptions so that future iterations of the project will be even better.
