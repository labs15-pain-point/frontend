                The purpose of this project is to help Lambda School generate ideas for their students to work on. As Lambda School continues to grow, it has become difficult to keep up with idea generation for projects.  That is where we come in. Our team has made use of leading edge technology in text generation to help create company descriptions.  Using a data set of 150,000 company descriptions and training on top of OpenAIâ€™s GPT-2 neural network, we were able to generate company descriptions that have the potential to be used by people in the real world.
